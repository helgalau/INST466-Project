How does workplace minority take effect in some of the largest tech companies? Apple, Microsoft, and Google have shocking statistics from employee demographics. For example, white people make up 55% of the employees at Apple, while 19% are Hispanic. This issue is more complex than simply meeting a diversity quota. In order to ensure minorities have a place in these spaces, we need to get to the bottom of a couple of issues. Some of these issues would be figuring out the reason why minorities aren’t given the same opportunities and why they are leaving these large tech companies at such an alarming rate. Although there needs to be urgency regarding  companies hiring a more diverse workforce, we also need to focus on how we can reform the environment that these large tech companies have made toxic.
